# Radius

Radius is a developer-centric cloud-native application platform.

The core of Radius is using the declarative **application model** to describe complete applications that can be managed and deployed with an intelligent control plane. Radius uses the [Bicep](https://github.com/azure/bicep) language as a file-format and infrastructure-as-code tool.

## Overview

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubation project.

At a high level, Radius contains
- Extensions to the Bicep language
- Application model that represents developer concepts with a declarative model
- Schemas for different compute and non-compute resource types
- CLI tools for deployment and management
- Multiple runtimes for application hosting
  - *For now* this is just Kubernetes

## Goals

- Enable developers to easily model their multi cloud appications 
  - For now we support Azure and AWS
- Enable portability across clouds. developers cans easily model their appications once and use it to deploy their application to any public cloud. 
- Be community driven, open and vendor neutral
- Gain new contributors
- Be incrementally adoptable.

## How it works

Radius contains extensions to Bicep language, that enables developers to model applications. Radius Cli consumes this bicep file and communicates with 
Universal Control Plane to deploy the application. Univeral Control Plane in turn works with Radius Core and Link Resource Providers to deploy various Application resources.It also communicates with other Cloud Providers as neccessary to set the resources for an appication.
