# About

The file structure in thi folder mimics the structure found in the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repository for the purpose of generating the bicep extensibility provider.

The file located at `schemas/rest-api-specs/test/specification/radius/resource-manager/Microsoft.CustomProviders/preview/2018-09-01-preview/radius.json` contains the OpenAPI schema for Radius v3. It is auto-generated by `make generate` based on the JSON schema in `pkg/radrp/schema`.

The `schemas/rest-api-specs/test/specification/radius/resource-manager/readme.md` file is a sort of configuration file that conforms with the requirements for [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) and is consumed alongside the `radius.json` file by the bicep types generator (found in `hack/bicep-types-radius/src/generator`) to produce the inputs for the bicep extensibility provider for Radius.
